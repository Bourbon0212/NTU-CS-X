# **Introduction**

## Exploratory & Explanatory

* Explore: Confirm & Analysis -> Data
* Explain: Inform & Persuade  -> Reader

## Explore ggplot2
Compare teo graphs below, see what's the difference.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = cyl, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

The first plot is not quite right, because ggplot2 treats ```cyl``` as a continuous variable, and it gives the impression that there is such a thing as a 5 or 7-cylinder car, which there is not.   
After turnig adding ```factor```, ggplot2 now treats ```cyl``` as a ```factor```. This time the x-axis does not contain variables like 5 or 7, only the values that are present in the dataset.   

## Grammar of Graphics    

* Principles
    + Graphics are made up of distinct layers of grammatical elements.    
    + Meaningful plots are built around appropriate aesthetic mappings.   
    + ggplot(```data```,```aes```) + ```geom``` + ```optional layers```
* Elements
    + 3 must have layers & 4 optional.    
    + Executed the command with ```+```.    
    *Required*
    + Data: The dataset being plotted.
    + Aesthetics: The scales onto which we ***map*** our data   
    + Geometries: The visual elements used for our data.    
    *Optional*
    + Facets: Plotting small multiples.
    + Statistics: Representations of our data to aid understanding.   
    + Coordinates: The space on which data will be plotted.
    + Themes: All none-data ink.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(aes(colour = clarity),se = F)#se -> 要不要顯示誤差範圍

# **Data**

## Base plot vs. ggplot2
* Base plot Limitation

    + Plot doesn't get redrawn.   
    + Plot is drawn as an image.    
    + Need to manually add legend.    
    + No unified framework for plotting.    

* Advantages of ggplot2   

    + Creates plotting objects, which can be manipulated
    + Takes care of a lot of the leg work for you, such as choosing nice color palettes and making legends.   
    + Built upon the grammar of graphics plotting philosophy, making it more flexible and intuitive for understanding the relationship between your visuals and your data.    
    
Let's see how complex it will be if we use the base plot().
```{r}
#Convert cyl to factor
mtcars$cyl <- as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
```
```{r eval = F}
#Example from base R
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, col = mtcars$cyl)
abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars), lty = 2)
lapply(mtcars$cyl, function(x) {
  abline(lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars, subset = (cyl == x)), col = x)
  })
```
<div style="width:600px; height:400px">

</div>
Now try with ggplot2 package.
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, col = cyl)) +
  geom_point() + # Copy from Plot 2
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = F) + # Copy from Plot 2
  geom_smooth(aes(group = 1),method = 'lm', se = F, linetype = 2)
```

## Tidy Data
### Reference: **[Cleaning Data in R](https://bourbon0212.github.io/NTU-CS-X/Week2/Cleaning_Data_in_R.html)**   

* **gather(```df```, ```key```, ```val```, ```-col```)**: Rearranges the data frame by specifying the columns that are categorical variables with a ```-``` notation.     
* **spread(```df```, ```key```, ```val```)**: Spread key-value pairs to columns.
* **separate(```df```, ```col```, ```into(c("col1", "col2"))```, sep = '')**: Separate one column into multiple.   
* **unite(```df```, ```col```, ...(bare names of columns), sep = '')**: Unite multiple columns into one.   

What kind of graph you want to plot determine how ypu tidy of ypur messy data.
```{r}
library(tidyr)
#iris.tidy
iris.tidy <- iris %>%
  gather(key, Value, -'Species') %>%
  separate(key, c("Part", "Measure"), "\\.")
head(iris.tidy)
ggplot(iris.tidy, aes(x = Species, y = Value, col = Part)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_grid(. ~ Measure)

#iris.wide
iris$Flower <- 1:nrow(iris)
iris.wide <- iris %>%
  gather(key, value, -Species, -Flower) %>%
  separate(key, c('Part','Measure'), "\\.") %>%
  spread(Measure, value)
head(iris.wide)
ggplot(iris.wide, aes(x = Length, y = Width, color = Part)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  facet_grid(. ~ Species)
```
